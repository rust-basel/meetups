 #### When settin up or starting your own project
 
 
 - when starting your own project think about one feature and only implement that in this session
 
 - in both casestry to use cargo commands to get things done
  - cargo init
  - cargo add <dependency>
  - cargo run
  - cargo test
  - cargo fmt
  - cargo clippy --fix
  - cargo install --path .
